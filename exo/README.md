# Your External Brain

This is where the magic accumulates. As you vibe with W/M/C, patterns will emerge and live here.

## Structure

- `patterns/` - Recurring solutions that actually work
- `perspectives/` - New thinking modes you discover you need
- `scratch/` - Today's working memory (delete anytime)

## How It Grows

Don't force it. After a few sessions, you'll notice:
- "We always debug this way" → Save to patterns/
- "I need a Security perspective" → Add to perspectives/
- Random code and notes → Throw in scratch/

The organization emerges from use, not planning.

*Let it be messy. Let it evolve. Trust the vibe.*
